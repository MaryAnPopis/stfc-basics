                This applies mostly to when you start being able to mine and refine 3* materials. Here are the overall
                tips:
                <ul>
                    <li>Get a North star as soon as you can in the game. While it has low cargo capacity, it is good
                        for fast mining. This ship is worth maxing out.
                    </li>
                    <li>As you start <a href="#faction-locking" class="anchor">faction locking</a>, make sure to get
                        the
                        faction miners and tier them up to at least tier 4.
                    </li>
                    <li>Always promote Stonn, T'Pring and Barot as soon as you can, also use them as captains of you
                        mining
                        ships based on whatever you are mining.
                    </li>
                    <li>Unless you are doing missions or grinding hostiles with multiple ships at once, keep all your
                        other ships mining.
                    </li>
                    <li>Get all faction miners.

                            STFC does not give you a way to sort officers by stat. You can
                            do the selections manually or use fill up a file like
                            <a aria-label="Downloadable excel file"

                            with your officer information (make sure they are off ship
                            when you fill it up). If you fill up this file, you will only
                            need to update it when you promote or level officers and if
                            you do research that applies to all officers. This file will
                            give you the opportunity to sort by stat and remove officers
                            you have in other ships when building crews. Focus on the

                        This is very simple. Never upgrade Ops until you have completed all
                        buildings and research for your current level. Combat, mining and
                        a lot of other things are greatly influenced by buildings and
                        research. Also, if you upgrade Ops, your dailies increase. You
                        can check the dailies for a given level using this

                    <h3>Faction locking</h3>
                    <p>
                        While doing missions or killing hostiles in Federation, Romulan
                        or Klingon space, you can increase or decrease your reputation
                        to these factions. The better the reputation, the more options
                        you have in the faction store to get things like recruit tokens
                        or ship blueprints. Here are a few facts:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If your reputation to a faction goes below 0, every time you
                            enter a system by that faction, your ship will get a chaser (a
                            hostile ship chasing yours). Faction store also gets closed
                            and there are no dailies for that faction.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you get to 10 million, the value will never go down from
                            that (AKA, faction has been locked). This opens the
                            possibility to start getting prints for your first epic ship
                            (Enterprise, D4 and Augur).

                            It is generally recommended to lock factions 1 at a time,
                            however you could theoretically do 2, but it would take a lot
                            of time.

                    <p>
                        As soon as you start getting missions that give you faction
                        reputation, choose a faction and archive the missions that increase
                        your reputation for the other factions. Here are some tips for
                        locking the first one:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always do your faction dailies.</li>
                        <li>
                            Always hit faction transports instead of any other ship,
                            transports usually give 2 times or more reputation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To do your dailies, choose the appropriate faction to kill
                            hostiles for:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you choose the Federation, hit Klingons.</li>
                                <li>If you choose Klingons, hit Romulans.</li>
                                <li>If you choose Romulans, hit the Federation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Always join the daily reputation event. If you feel you
                            cannot finish it, you can donate the necessary resources to
                            your alliance, and it will count towards the event.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add an additional “daily” to go get some Inert Nanoprobes,
                            refine them into Charged Nanoprobes and convert them to
                            reputation points. You can do this daily.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Kill as many hostiles of the highest level you can per day.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
